# User-Login-Interface
The above is a Login interface with user authentication which was done for learning purposes. It was a great experience as it was the first time I created such a program using Nodejs and React. I used Bcrypt to build a password security platform that scales with computation power. Bcrypt is a popular and trusted method for salt and hashing passwords.
